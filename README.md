# Chill Hacker Dark

### A theme for VS Code

My plan is an application interface that was very simple relaxing dark and then the syntax highlighting would have
various greens and grays for the hacker style look.  

### Here are some tools to help
  
Open a window to preview changes:  Run > Start Debugging
